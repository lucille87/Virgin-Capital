    countries at any time at its sole discretion. The Clients originating and/or residing in such countries will not be

    <p>4.2. The amendments to the restricted countries list can be performed by the Company at any time without prior notice

    binding contracts and of legal age. Under no circumstances shall the Company provide any services to persons under 18.
    Such accounts, in case opened, shall be automatically closed and (if necessary) refunded. No exceptions shall be made
    from this provision.</p>

    <p>5.2. The Company reserves a right to deny a Client, refuse to provide its services to a particular individual or a legal
    entity, cancel any of his/her/its accounts, and discontinue serving the Client at the Company’s sole discretion without

    <p>5.3. The Company shall not be liable in any way for any piece of information published at support@virgincapital.co by third
    parties (such as public comments, judgements, advices, opinions, etc) and for any information regarding the Company in
    any other websites. By the nature of the Internet none of the information can be fully controlled and must therefore be
    considered carefully prior to making any decisions and/or actions on its basis.</p>

    <h3>6. KYC procedures</h3>
    <p>6.1. Upon registration with Virgin Capital and, therefore, acceptance of the Agreement, a Client shall be provided
    with an account at Virgin Capital. The account owner data as well as the other relevant details shall be provided by
    the Client as required by the Company and the regulation.</p>

    <p>6.2. The information provided (such as the Client’s name, address, phone number, mobile number, email, etc) shall be
    subject to KYC procedures and verification.</p>

    <p>6.3. It is the Client’s sole responsibility and obligation to ensure the information provided is correct, complete,
    true, accurate, relevant and up-to-date.</p>

    <p>6.4. The provision of misleading, false or outdated information may be considered a legal offence and may lead to the
    immediate closure of the Client’s account.</p>

    <p>6.5. In any cases when the Security department has grounds to suspect that account has been accessed and used by a third
    party, the Company reserves a right to request a video call via Skype to confirm Client's identity. In such case the
    Client must be able to confirm during the video call his/her trade patterns and provide the Company with identification
    documents. In case of strong grounds' presence to presume that account has been seized by a third party the Company
    reserves a right to stop all activity of the account until the identification video call via Skype is made. In
    considerations of privacy of the Company's Security department agents during the video call the Client will not have a
    video of agents.<br>If during 15 days after the request submission to confirm the identity of the account holder the Client hasn't contacted
    the Company providing convenient time for the call, the Company reserves a right to terminate the account without the
    reimbursement of any losses or profits.</p>

    <p>6.6. According to the regulatory requirements, a complete compliance shall be performed by the Company on the Client’s
    information. The scope of the measures constitutes Virgin Capital AML policy.</p>

    <p>6.7 As a part of the AML policy the client shall be required to verify his/her account information prior to performing
    any financial or trading transactions. The verification shall include the submission of a color passport/ID copy,
    residence address proof, credit card possession proof (if applicable) and other documents as required by the EU AML
    directives. The scope of the documents required can be amended by the Company in accordance with the legislation.
    If requested documents are not provided during 30 days the Company has a right to refund the deposit and terminate the
    account. Profits or losses will not be reimbursed in such cases.</p>

    <h3>7. Investment advice waiver</h3>
    <p>7.1. The Client unconditionally agrees that no information provided to the Client by Virgin Capital by means of the
    website, trading platform or any other means shall be considered an investment advice from the Company. None of the
    information published by the Company shall be intended to affect the Client’s trading decision(s) in any way. The
    Company shall not bear any liabilities thereof and shall not be liable for any losses incurred as a result of the
    Client's trading.</p>

    <p>7.2. The losses that the Client may bear are restricted solely by his/her personal funds deposited into the Company. No
    additional fees can be implied as a result of the Client’s trading.</p>

    <h3>8. Account risks</h3>

    <p>8.1. The Client acknowledges that by definition he/she is the only person authorized to perform any trading activity in
    his/her account. Should the Client decide to grant access to his/her account to any third person and authorize this
    person to trade, the Client unconditionally accepts that he/she will bear complete responsibility for this action. The
    Company shall not be liable for any results (whether positive or negative) of such behaviour.</p>
    <p>8.2. The deal closes according to the expiration time. If during the low volatility market there were less than three
    ticks in a deal it will not be recognized as a valid one. The investment of the deal shall be reimbursed to the trading
    balance.</p>

    <h3>9. Deposits</h3>
    <p>9.1. No deposits shall be accepted from the third parties. Such deposits shall be refunded immediately. This in
    particular is related to the credit/debit card deposits. The cardholder name without exceptions must match the account
    holder name. Any deposits failing to comply with this rule shall be voided immediately.</p>

    <p>9.2. In case the deposit option nature does not presuppose instant credit and requires certain time to be processed
    (i.e. local or global bank wire transfer) the deposit shall be performed via a deposit notice. The deposit notice shall
    be created by the Client in his/her personal area. Upon reception of the funds the Company shall process the deposit
    request accordingly (i.e. credit the Client’s account with the actual received amount). The Client acknowledges that by
    nature of the bank transfer in exceptional cases such request may take up to 14 business days to be processed.</p>

    <h3>10. Record Keeping</h3>
    <p>10.1. The Client acknowledges that all the phone conversations, live chat logs, emails and other conversations shall be
    recorded by the Company.</p>
    <p>10.2. The records shall remain the Company’s property during the whole storage time.</p>
    <p>10.3. Under no circumstances shall the Company disclose any information contained in the records unless requested under
    the court verdict or any other legal request from the governing bodies.</p>
    <p>10.4. The Client agrees that the data may be used for the Company’s marketing and research activities held from time to
    time.</p>

    <p>11.1. The Company’s website, all materials and information contained therein, trading platform, brand name, domain
    names, etc are protected by the international copyright legislation.</p>
    <p>11.2. It is strictly prohibited to copy, represent, or in any other way use this information for the purpose of
    promoting whatever activities and/or businesses.</p>
    <p>11.3. It is strictly prohibited to copy, publish, display, disclose, rent, modify, lease, distribute, decompile or
    reverse engineer the Virgin Capital trading platform. Any attempts to do so shall be the subject of the court hearings
    in accordance with the international intellectual property legislation.</p>

    <h3>12. Other sources</h3>
    <p>12.1. Links to other websites owned by the third parties may be posted at the Company’s website.</p>
    <p>12.2. Such links do not represent authorization, coordination, cooperation, authorization, affiliation, sponsorship or
    any other kind of relationship with the aforementioned parties. The Company shall not be liable to any damages or losses
    incurred as a result of the usage of the abovementioned websites.</p>

    <h3>13. Amendments</h3>
    <p>13.1. The Company reserves a right to update and/or amend the provisions of these Terms and Conditions subject to prior
    notification.</p>

    war, fire, civil commotion, terrorism, flood, storm, interruption of power supply, electronic, communication equipment
    failure, civil unrest, act of government, labour dispute, inability to communicate with quotes providers for whatever

    <p>14.2. The Company shall not be liable for any kind of loss or damage incurred by the Client due to a Force Majeure
    Event.</p>

    occurred or is about to occur; under such circumstances the Company shall take reasonable steps to inform the Client.</p>
    <p>14.4. If the Company determines that a Force Majeure Event occurred, at Company's sole discretion and without prejudice
    to the Client's rights under this Agreement, the Company may:<br>- close any open positions at a price that the Company considers reasonable
    
    - implement amendments to any closed positions<br>
    
    - amend the content of this Agreement by reason of impossibility for the Company to comply with it<br>
    
    - decline or postpone Client's funds withdrawal in a certain payment system</p>
    <p>14.5. The Company shall not be considered in breach of this Contract to the extent that performance of its respective
    obligations (excluding payment obligations) is prevented by a Force Majeure Event that arises.</p>
    <p>14.6. If a Force Majeure Event occurs, The Company shall, at all times take all reasonable steps within its respective
    powers and consistent with good faith and international industry practices (but without incurring unreasonable
    additional costs and at Company's sole discretion) to resolve every situation as it deems appropriate.</p>
